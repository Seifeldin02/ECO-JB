For the graphs, make a function that converts the string in the database to date values, so it can be more accurate, where the first 4 letters are the year, then month, then day etc...
If possible, make the user input on the graph be marked with something so the user can see where they fare with the rest of the data
And join us should have a verification process if the user is not verified, if they are verified it should prompt them to submit their carbon information for each electricity, waterbill, and whatnot

For Calender, make it so Users can view User calender, which Staff can put events in the Calender for Users, 
For Institution give them their own calender, where they can create Institution specific events which can be viewed by the user as well, user can navigate between IPKR calender (Made by staff) or Institution Calender

Only verified users can view calender and submit information
For verification they will send a form that only staff can see, and when staff sees the form, they will verify or decline the request based on whether it was accepted or not, they also
should get an email accordingly whether they were succesfully verified or not
When staff recieves the form for bills for the statistics it should be separated into statistics by users and statistics by institutions
Carob Analysis should have the carbon analysis charts for everyone
Calendar is the calendar for events made by staff or institutions
